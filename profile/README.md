# weavelabs 
weavelabs is a small team building an AI-Native platform for integration test automation. Our mission is to simplify and accelerate the development process by providing tools that help teams deliver high-quality software faster.

## Our Platform 
**Our platform focuses on three major features:**

- **Automatic Code Scanning and Analysis**: Scan and analyze code to automatically detect APIs, schema, and documentation. Our goal is to use this data to generate and continually update test artifacts.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: High-quality, synthetic datasets generated using machine-learning models. These datasets can be used for testing, training, and validation, reducing the need for manual data creation and increasing test coverage.
- **Test Management and Execution**: User-friendly UI to manage and generate use cases, test cases, test suites, and executable test scripts. The focus is to generate integration tests, performance tests, and end-to-end tests for most popular testing frameworks.
