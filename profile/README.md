# weavelabs 
Welcome to weavelabs, where we're building an AI-driven platform for the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Our mission is to simplify and accelerate the development process by providing cutting-edge tools and technologies that help teams deliver high-quality software faster.

## Our Platform 
*Our platform focuses on three major features:*

- *Automatic Code Scanning and Analysis*: Our Service Registry module uses AI-powered code scanning and analysis to automatically detect APIs, schema, and documentation. This provides a single pane of glass to view all services, making it easier to manage and understand complex systems.
- *Synthetic Data Generation*: Our Synthetic Data Generation module generates high-quality, synthetic datasets based on discovered schemas. These datasets can be used for testing, training, and validation, reducing the need for manual data creation and increasing test coverage.
- *Test Management and Execution*: Our Test Management and Execution module uses the Service Registry and generated data to automatically create Use Cases, Test Cases, Test Suites, and Executable Tests. This enables teams to generate integration tests, performance tests, and end-to-end tests with ease, all backed by powerful reporting dashboards.

## Open Source 
The best part? Our platform is Open Source! We believe that open collaboration and community involvement are essential for driving innovation and adoption. By making our platform open source, we invite developers, testers, and organizations to contribute, customize, and extend our tools to meet their specific needs.
